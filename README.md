# Sort Visualization App


## Objective

The objective if this app is to show a visual representation of 4 sorting algorithms. Them being: Bubble Sort, Recursive Bubble Sort, Selection Sort and Insertion Sort. This app hopes to make it easier for students to understand these sorting algorithms especially for people who are visual learners like me.
